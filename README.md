# Challenges Encountered
1. Complex API calls from both Google and Eventful were hard to parse and get to look good when differing information was available.
2. When we started, it would have been really nice to know what a Constructor function was.
3. Git data integrity was hard to manage since it was our first real group project of substance

# Plans for the future
1. I'm probably always going to pick at the code as I learn more of it.  
2. I will probably leave a front-end version up and available but I would like to remake this as a full-stack app using node and express and maybe reactJS.
3. User authentication (with php or google firebase maybe)
